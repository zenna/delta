#Delta Machines

Delta Machines are a model computation based upon transformation and propagation of beliefs.
We aim to synthesize ideas from network based models, particularly neural network based methods, with modern programming constructs (e.g. types, recursion, compositionality, encapsulation).

See tests for example.
